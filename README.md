# Technical Design Document (TDD)

I am [Alfonso Sanchez-Cortes](https://github.com/Siitoo), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in
Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s
subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](<https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu>).

## ¿What's a TDD?

The technical design document, usually written by the technical director or the programming leader,contains a technical description of the production of a game.
It includes details of all the software, hardware and game engine components that will be used during production, and what those particular tools will provide to the development team,
and includes a brief description of how the code will be written. The document is updated in different stages of the production of the game. It often comes and goes between the editor
and the developer as the technical details are better defined. For that reason, there is a box on the first page of the document that describes the changes made to the file and who made the changes.

In summary, TDD is a statement of the solution to a specific game concept outlined in a “Game Design Document” (GDD) and discusses things such as the following:
*Coding standards
*Technical design
*Tool instructions

### Coding standards

Documentation on the coding standards includes specifics on coding conventions, hardwares and software specifications, naming conventions, technologies used(including middleware), file types, data layout, and any other technical information that is necessary for developing the game. 
The documentation should also provide an overview of what all the functions and data do, and how they interact with each other.
